# What if we made AI help with filling the above boxes? ðŸ˜Ž

CodeRag is an AI Solution that parses your C# Code Repo + existing documentation you may have; add it to a VectorStore (RAG) and offer you (and users/colleagues) an AI solution to help better understand the code, help with documentation, and even Code Reviews

## Public or Private
``PUBLIC`` CodeRag offers any GitHub public repos to be indexed, with the Owner getting access to tweak settings.

``PRIVATE`` For Private Repos, you can clone this Repo and self-host for code-security (Require an Azure OpenAI Resource, an Azure SQL Database and a GitHub Account)

## Features

### Frontend

    }
  ]
}
```
